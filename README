Mistpark - Personal Edition
Version 1.0

Please see the file INSTALL for system requirements.

Mistpark introduces a new generation of social networks. Personal Edition
allows you to interact with other members of the Mistpark community using
the DFRN (Distributed Friends and Relations Network) protocol. Say good-bye
to Facebook and privacy issues. Say good-bye to Twitter and 140 characters.

It's your network now. If social networking isn't what you thought it would 
be, help us to make it better.  

Mistpark Personal Edition supports a single individual in the network. Also 
available from Mistpark Labs is Mistpark Server, which supports several
hundred people using commodity hosting platforms.

Mistpark is fully functional, however be aware that the supporting protocols
are still undergoing development and new features will be rolled out in the
coming weeks/months as these protocols mature. Version 2 is currently under
development and is scheduled for alpha testing during September 2010.

We also plan to provide gateways to other distributed networks (Diaspora,
Federated Social Web, etc.) as other networks become viable. Currently 
Diaspora has not yet released a product, and the Federated Social Web still
does not have a privacy/security model that we can evaluate.

We will be releasing online documentation and providing other resources in
the months ahead at http://mistpark.com

Welcome to your new social network.
