Mistpark Installation

This is an early release. Some manual installation is required at this time. 

1. Requirements
	- Apache with mod-rewrite enabled and "Options All" so you can use a 
local .htaccess file
	- PHP > 5.1. The later the better. You'll need 5.3 for full openssl 
encryption support
	- PHP *command line* access with register_argc_argv set to true in the 
php.ini file
	- Mysql 5.x
	- cron
	
	[Dreamhost.com offers all of the necessary hosting features at a 
reasonable price. If your hosting provider doesn't allow Unix shell access, 
you might have trouble getting everything to work.] 

2. Edit htconfig.php and change system settings. Rename to .htconfig.php 

3. Import database.sql into your database with mysql command line or via phpmyadmin

4. Put this directory into the root of your web server document area.

	- If you copy the directory tree to your webserver, make sure
	that you also copy .htaccess

	- To use a subdir of your main site, set the 
	config variable $a->path to the relative subdir
	in .htconfig.php - for example to use http://example.com/test - 
	use
		$a->path = 'test';

	- Everything will work much better if you can dedicate a domain 
	or subdomain so that you don't require an extra server path. 

5. Navigate to your site with a web browser and register an account.

http://mywebsite.com/register

6. Set up a cron job or scheduled task to run "cd base/directory; php include/poller.php http://mywebsite.com" once every 5-10 minutes.
Change base/directory and mywebsite.com as appropriate
